** Introduction

This document describes the specification and construction of a IoT LoRaWAN
capable device which can be easily constructed from readily available parts. The
aim of this device is to be a standard unit which can be used (with small
modifications) as the basis for constructing a large range of IoT devices
suitable for use by the IoT Experimenters group and beyond.

Things to consider:
- Cost

  It would be good to produce a low cost kit with more expensive
  components being optional extras. This will reduce the barrier to entry in the
  hobby, whether that be via individual purchases, or sponsored group projects.

- Ease of use

  The kit needs to be easy to program and use. This will be achieved by concise
  documentation on how to enable a basic functionality of the device and allow
  it to be tested.

- Complete

  When assembled the kit should form a complete finished product (software,
  packaging, documentation). 

** Specification  

The kit will produce a hardware sensor unit which will:

- Transmit application data to the LoRaWAN network;
- Include a basic sensor (yet to be decided)
- Support connectionless operation via battery and solar panel;
- Support low power operation, for long duration sensing applications;
- Is programmed via the Arduino IDE (Online - preferred, or Desktop);
- Uses standard Arduino Libaries, where possible);
- Use a 3D printed case, which can be produced locally (with available SDL files);
- Be expandable and adaptable for other projects; and
- Suitable for outdoor applications.

*** Initial Sensor Options
- Push button
- Temperature and Humidity Sensor x 2 (suitable for monitoring nesting boxes)
- LED Feedback (display downloaded status from LoRaWA Network)

** Component Candidates
*** Microprocessor Board
**** Arduino MKR WAN 1310 (current preferred option)
This board initially appears to support all of the specification requirements.
[[../hardware/lorawan-arduino-mkrwan1310.org][Details]]

*** Battery - Li-Po 3.7V
**** Core Electroncs [[https://core-electronics.com.au/polymer-lithium-ion-battery-1000mah-38458.html][LiPo 3.7V 1100mAh]] $15.35

*** Solar Panel
**** Core Electronics [[https://core-electronics.com.au/monocrystalline-solar-panel-5v-1a.html][Monocrystalline]] $22.69
- Maximum power: 6W
- 27.5cm x 17cm
- 5V 1A
- Includes voltage regulator with USB adapter underneath

*** Case
- 3D printed with SDL available
- Supporting multiple mounting options

*** Additional hardware
- screws
- connectors and cables

** Examples

*** Low Power MKR WAN 1310 IoT Sensor Project
